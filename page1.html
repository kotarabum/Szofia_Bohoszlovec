    <div class="text" style="font-size:1.5vw" > I am Szofia Bohoslovec, an ambitious, self-driven and hardworking graduated student from Central Saint Martinâ€™s, 
        University of the Arts London looking to expand my experience and to share my vision of the future of city centres whilst 
        developing my own architectural manifesto by learning from everyone and everything around me. 
        I love to look ahead at the many design shifts required to move with our ever-changing lifestyles, technologies and population needs.
        Having exposed myself to a number of jobs whilst a student, I have enjoyed personally integrating space qualities through the eyes 
        of a interior designer, web designer, marketing assistant and translator. Feeding this back into my architectural work has greatly
         helped me empathise and embody the way a diversity of people interact with a given space. I am open minded to new technologies 
         and cultures as well as political and social perspectives. I am committed to developing my architectural philosophy by integrating 
         all of my experiences to meet our exciting and challenging future.
