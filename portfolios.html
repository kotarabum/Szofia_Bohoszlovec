    <p1 class="p1">   Stage 2 Brief “Temple of meditation in alternative future” proposing the future of Fleet Street in next 2000 year’s, it can be 
        predicted that current problems and events occurring around the world and down to the 
        site will permanently change our mindset: generation suffering from race and gender inequalities, COVID-19, climate change, urbanisation and economic crisis may lead to 
        human depression. the temple of meditation is designed for local people to help reach nirvana on the mental level and fulfil the 
        universe with somebody or alone to overcome anxiety or simply have a break after hard day. Construction method combines the feeling of vertical forest that consist of 
        large variety of plant species and virtual reality system into collaborative space of calmness and endless existence of a space of 
        continues growth. Project integrate variety of conceptual models and sketches of progress, however the final outcome model has 
        set the main sequences and elements of the proposal that essential to keep building running for long time frames </p1>

    <p2 class="p2"> Stage 3 “Metamorphose of Rye Lane” representS site research and activating site elements for advertising local culture and vibes.
        Peckham attracts a lot of people by the rooftops and variety of 
        food and take away, however gentrification of the street declined few small businesses that 
        locals used to meet with each other. Residents create conversation on the street, unfortunately, there is no space for exchange of ideas and 
        celebration affordable for every visitor. Renovation will include circular economy system, 
        recycling local elements such as scaffold and wood, landscape garden on the top of retails 
        and sum up it into “roller coaster” adventures pavilion for kids and parents and young adults. </p2>
